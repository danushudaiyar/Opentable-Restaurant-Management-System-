OpenTable Clone – Restaurant Management System

Project Overview:
This project is a full-stack web application simulating OpenTable.com, developed as part of my coursework under Professor Zuo in January 2025. The application allows users to browse restaurants, make reservations, manage bookings, and explore menu items, while providing an administrative interface to manage restaurant operations efficiently.

Technical Highlights:

Developed using ASP.NET Core MVC, HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap 5 for a responsive front-end with advanced filtering, pagination, and user/admin navigation.

Implemented Entity Framework Core with Model-First design, RESTful routing, and .NET Identity for secure authentication, authorization, and CRUD operations, ensuring scalability and maintainability.

Managed weekly deliverables, presentations, and iterative feedback from Professor Zuo, which reinforced professional development practices and real-world project management skills.

Explored AI tools to enhance development efficiency, including automating certain tasks and improving workflow.

Learning & Impact:
This was a time-intensive project that pushed me to adapt to changing requirements, plan efficiently, and present progress effectively. Beyond technical skills, it strengthened my abilities in problem-solving, iterative development, and applying emerging technologies—all critical in professional software development and startup environments.

Skills Gained:

C#, ASP.NET Core MVC, Razor Pages

SQL Server and Entity Framework Core

Git and GitHub version control

Agile-style iterative development and project presentations

AI-assisted development and automation

Conclusion:
This project demonstrates my ability to deliver a fully functional, secure, and scalable web application while navigating real-world challenges and evolving requirements. It reflects both technical competence and the professional mindset needed to contribute effectively in a software engineering or startup role.
